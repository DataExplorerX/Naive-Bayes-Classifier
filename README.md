## Naive Bayes Classifier:
Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of conditional independence between every pair of features given the value of the class variable.
### Bayes’ Theorem provides a way that we can calculate the probability of a piece of data belonging to a given class, given our prior knowledge. Bayes’ Theorem is stated as:

P(class|data) = (P(data|class) * P(class)) / P(data)
Where P(class|data) is the probability of class given the provided data.


### Note

While Naive Bayes is a simple and effective algorithm, its "naive" assumption of independence between features may not hold true in all scenarios. For more complex natural language processing tasks, other advanced models like Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests, or deep learning architectures could be explored.

Feel free to experiment with the code, try different feature extraction techniques, or incorporate additional data preprocessing steps to improve the classifier's performance for your specific use case. Happy analyzing!
